            Hey there, I'm Romário de Brito, a laid-back 23-year-old from the beautiful island of São Vicente in Cabo Verde. Currently, I'm studying Computer and Telecommunications Engineering at Atlantic Technical University (UTA). I've always been curious and love learning, especially when it comes to all things tech-related. I enjoy exploring the latest gadgets and keeping up with tech trends. When I'm not immersed in my studies or tinkering with technology, you can find me chilling out and soaking up the relaxed vibes of island life. As Romário, I'm excited to apply my skills and passion to make a positive impact in the world of computer science and telecommunications. Let's ride the wave of tech together and keep it cool!
